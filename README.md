# Design and development of an embedded system for the air quality monitoring

## Overview
  
The purpose of this project is to detect and monitoring some harmful gasses, such as  Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Methane. Using a simple Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 connected with a specific sensor, data are collected and sent to an IoT Framework known as [Measurify](https://measurify.org/) (previously "Atmosphere"). 
In order to monitoring, is been created a simple web application which shows the gasses' concentration trend over the days.
